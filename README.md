THINKFUL DRILLS AND PROJECTS

This folder contains the following drills and small projects completed for the Thinkful Data Science bootcamp, sorted numerically by the unit number (which means they're mostly listed in the order I built them).  The early drills (dating back to April 2018) do not reflect my current level of understanding, and none of them are as polished or comprehensive as my Stylometer app (January 2018) or my Thinkful capstone projects.  But they do demonstrate some idea of types of topics I've covered and my general work habits.

** 2.1.8 Preparing a Dataset for Modeling.ipynb **
Cleaning, exploration, and some interesting feature engineering on a set of Uber NYC pickup data

** 2.7 Sentiment classification challenge.ipynb **
Basic sentiment classification using single word appearance and a Bernoulli NB model.  Includes testing of my function add_best_words.py, which attempts to select the optimal top N word-features (by Bayesian probability analysis) for classification out of the full dataset.

** 2.3.3 The Extraordinary Power of Explanatory Power.ipynb **
Some drills in assessing predictive models: error distributions, heteroscedasticity checks, etc.

** 2.4.2, 2.4.4, 2.5.2 NY crime data.ipynb **
A series of drills examining, cleaning, feature engineering, modeling, and assessing New York state crime data.

** Gradient Boosting Challenge.ipynb **
Various efforts to improve on a Thinkful-provided predictive model on the global happiness survey, including a randomized hyperparameter sweep and polynomial feature combinations.

** Airline Delay Prediction.ipynb **
A project on predicting airline delays using all US flight data from 2008.  Includes some interesting dataframe manipulations for feature engineering.

** Clustering Challenge.ipynb **
PCA reduction followed by assessing various parameter sets of several different clustering techniques, with an emphasis on silhouette analysis.  Uses custom utility function show_silhouettes_alt.
